# Pygame Lab #1 - Draw A Picture                   

## Step #1 - Background Info
* Make sure you have Pygame installed (Lesson 6.0)
* Review Lesson 6.1 and 6.2

## Step #2 - Create a Picture
* Copy and paste the Pygames Template (Found in Lesson 6.1) in pygame_lab_1.py.
* Your picture must meet the following conditions:
  * You must use multiple colors.
  * You must have a coherent picture. I am not interested in abstract art with random shapes.
  * You must use at least 4 types of shapes (e.g. ellipses, rectangles, lines, arcs, polygons etc.)
  * Make sure at least one object can be animated for a future Pygame Lab
  * Make sure the window caption matches the drawing
